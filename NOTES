==== Partial builds: configure.php versus phd ====

Building a partial build (e.g., for one book id) is used, and there 
are two methods for creating them. Creating a "partial" build with 
configure.php wraps the generated XML with an extra <section>, so 
instead we rely on using --partial with PhD.

====== Using configure.php =====
  $ php doc-base/configure.php --with-partial=book.mysql
  $ phd --docbook doc-base/.manual.book.mysql.xml --package MySQL --format docbook --mysql-output=c_test.xml

====== Using PhD =====
  $ php doc-base/configure.php
  $ phd --docbook doc-base/.manual.book.mysql.xml --partial book.mysql --package MySQL --format docbook --mysql-output=p_test.xml
